This version of ambed is compatible with:
- DF2ET's AMBE3003USB opensource device (https://github.com/phl0/AMBE3003USB)
- LX3JL's USB-3006 opensource device (https://github.com/lx3jl/usb-3006)
- DVSI's USB-3000 device
- DVSI's USB-3003 device
- DVSI's USB-3012 device
- NWDR's ThumbDV device
- NWDR's ThumbDV-3 device
- DVMEGA AMBE3000 device
- DVMEGA AMBE3003 device

Available transcoding channels per device:

device			DMR->DSTAR		DSTAR->DMR		Nb Of concurrent channels
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
3000(pair)		1				1				2
3003			1				1				2
3003(pair)		3				3				4
3003-3000(pair)	2				2				not tested
3006			3				3				6
3012			6				6				12

Multiple devices can be used at the same time.
You need to use 3000 by pairs or paired with a 3003
Do not to use USB hubs as they have proven making
system behaviour unreliable.

Instructions:
=============

1) Installation of FTDI drivers

Download from FTDI web site the latest D2XX driver package (tested on 1.4.6).
Follow FTDI provided documentation for installation and testing of the drivers.


2) installation of g++ compiler

# apt-get install build-essential
# apt-get install g++-4.7

2) download and compile ambed

# git clone https://github.com/LX3JL/xlxd.git
# cd xlxd/ambed/
# make clean
# make
# make install

3) configuring ambed startup script

# nano /ambed/run

edit following line to match your IP:

sudo /ambed/ambed 127.0.0.1 &

if ambed is running on same machine than xlxd, use default 127.0.0.1
otherwise use the machine own IP


4) running ambed

note:
Due to specific FTDI driver implementation, ambed must be running
with root privilege, and cannot be run as a daemon.
So ambed will display the information and error messages in the
terminal it has been started from

plug at least one USB-3xxx USB device

# cd /ambed
# ./run
 
 
during initialisation phase, ambed will scan all USB port to discover
and configure ans report status of all available USB-3xxx devices


5) stoping ambed

find PID of ambed process, using for example ps

# ps ax | grep ambed

and kill the process

# kill xxxx

where xxxx is PID found previously.
